## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser
- Basic web server (optional for local development)

### Running Locally

1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecosystem_stats.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory
```
cd ecosystem_stats
```

3. Either:
   - Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or
   - Serve it using a simple HTTP server:
     ```
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```
     Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

### Hosting on Vercel

This dashboard can be easily deployed on Vercel for fast, global hosting:

1. Push your repository to GitHub
2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and sign up/login (you can use your GitHub account)
3. Click "Add New" and select "Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository (you may need to install the Vercel GitHub app first)
5. Configure project settings:
   - Framework Preset: Select "Other" (static HTML)
   - Build and Output Settings: Leave defaults
   - Environment Variables: Add any if needed
6. Click "Deploy"

Your dashboard will be deployed and accessible at a Vercel URL (e.g., `ecosystem-stats.vercel.app`).

For a custom domain:
1. Go to your project settings in Vercel
2. Navigate to the "Domains" section
3. Add your custom domain (e.g., `ecosystem-stats.arc.fun`)
4. Follow Vercel's instructions to set up the required DNS records (typically a CNAME record)

## Live Metrics Pipeline

Automated GitHub workflows run the Python scripts under `metrics/` and `api/`.
These fetch stats from GitHub, Telegram, X and the Solana blockchain. Updated
metrics and achievement files are written to the `data/` directory and
committed back to the repository so the dashboard always serves fresh data.

### Required GitHub Secrets

- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `GROUP_CHAT_ID`
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` and `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID`
- `REPO` â€“ repository in `owner/name` form
- `HELIUS_API_KEY` and `TOKEN_ADDRESS`

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main dashboard layout and content
- `dashboard.js` - JavaScript for dashboard interactivity and chart rendering
- `styles.css` - Custom styles beyond Tailwind
- `logos/` - Directory containing partner and project logos

## Customizing the Dashboard

To update logos or project information manually:

1. Update partner logos in the `logos/` directory
2. Modify project details in the Arc Ecosystem section as needed

All metrics JSON files in `data/` are automatically updated by the GitHub
workflows described below.
